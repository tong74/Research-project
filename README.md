#Abstractï¼šVehicle road recognition systems play a pivotal role
in intelligent vehicle driving, particularly as reduced visibility
in foggy conditions often leads to frequent road accidents. Past
studies have demonstrated that integrating dehazing algorithms
with classification methods for foggy weather images can lead
to the discovery of optimal models. Recently, researchers have
focused on combining Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and AOD-
Net models to dehaze and classify images in foggy conditions, and
on employing Faster R-CNN for fine-tuning on datasets under
foggy circumstances to find the best AI model. Our research
aims to explore how to achieve higher accuracy with the best AI
model in foggy conditions. In our work, we utilized a combination
of DNN and AOD-Net models to process images during foggy
weather, and further trained and fine-tuned the Faster R-CNN
based on the processed dataset. Our results indicate that the
combination of DNN with Faster R-CNN yields more accurate
results compared to combining CNN with Faster R-CNN. The
provided code is ready for direct use
